## Description of Design
1. Each kind of elements that appear in the game will be mapped to a single class to manage their behaviors. The instance of GameEngine class is used to handle the interaction between them, while App displays the interactive results in draw() function.
2. The 4 kinds of ghosts (Whim, Chaser, Ambusher, and Ignorant) all have some common behaviors and logic. Differences appear in their target locations of SCATTER and CHASE modes, so the superclass Ghosts is established which defines the whole moving algorithm of ghosts as well as the interaction with the player(WAKA), and the target positions will be re-specified in child classes (Whim...)

Notes:  all files included config1.json to config3.json "and "all map.txt files " are for test cases.
